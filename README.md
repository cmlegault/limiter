# Limiter

Shiny app to evaluate impact of different quotas and average survey biomass limits on Georges Bank yellowtail flounder. Presented in TRAC 2020 meeting.

The create_avg.r code uses the three survey csv files to generate the avgb.csv. These files and the pointest.csv need to be updated when new survey information becomes available.

Modified after 2021 TRAC meeting to allow choice of original survey values or newly accepted Miller et al. survey values.
